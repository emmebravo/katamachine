// takes the short-sighted solution
// given a decision, it's going to do the one that looks like the best decision at that time without considering the big picture
// eg: when you tell a toddler one cookie now, or two later, they'll likely take the one cookie now

// GREEDY APPROACH
// greedy algos always make the locally optimal choice
// use? when your data set is so big that you can't think of all the different scenarios bc it's just computationally too much
// it's better to have a solution than no solution

/*

You are the banker in Monopoly with your family who has lost many of the game pieces so you only have bills in these denominations:Â 

$5 $10 $25

You need only pay out your family in the least number of bills possible so you don't run out before the game is over. Write a function that calculates the least number of bills required for any given dollar amount that is divisible by 5.
